        An institution where higher education is taught is commonly called a university college or university. In
        addition to these core schools, students in a given country may also attend schools before and after primary
        (elementary in the U.S.) and secondary (middle school in the U.S.) education.[3]
        Kindergarten or preschool provide some schooling to very young children (typically ages 3â€“5). University,
        vocational school, college or seminary may be available after secondary school. A school may be dedicated to one
        particular field, such as a school of economics or dance. Alternative schools may provide nontraditional
        curriculum and methods.

        A school is both the educational institution and building designed to provide learning spaces and learning
        environments for the teaching of students under the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal
        education, which is sometimes compulsory.[2] In these systems, students progress through a series of schools
        that can be built and operated by both government and private organization.
        The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional terms section below) but generally
        include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary
        education. An institution where higher education is taught is commonly called a university college or
        university. In addition to these core schools, students in a given country may also attend schools before and
        after primary (elementary in the U.S.) and secondary (middle school in the U.S.) education.[3] Kindergarten or
        preschool provide some schooling to very young children (typically ages 3â€“5). University, vocational school,
        college or seminary may be available after secondary school. A school may be dedicated to one particular field,
