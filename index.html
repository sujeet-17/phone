            The iPhone is one of the two largest smartphone platforms in the world alongside Android, and is a large
            part of the luxury market.
            The iPhone has generated large profits for Apple, making it one of the world's most valuable publicly traded
            companies.
            The first-generation iPhone was described as a "revolution" for the mobile phone industry and subsequent
            models have also garnered praise.
            The iPhone has been credited with popularizing the smartphone and slate form factor, and with creating a
            large market for smartphone apps, or <mark>"app economy"</mark>.

            The iPhone 15, 15 Plus, 15 Pro, and 15 Pro Max were announced on September 12, 2023.
            Starting with this group of devices, all models switch to using USB-C as their power connector to comply
            with European Commission regulations, replacing Apple's proprietary Lightning connector after eleven years
            of use in previous models.
            All models feature the Dynamic Island, which debuted with the iPhone 14 Pro (effectively retiring the
            "notch" display cutout), slightly curved edges, and a frosted glass back.
            The iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max also replace the mute switch and stainless-steel edges with the "Action"
            button and titanium, respectively
